# kinetic-chemistry
Some script I made for a lab report about kinetic chemistry using polinomial approximation.

The datos2 file has data ordered in columns, first two columns are the water and tiosulfate of sodium volumes (in mililiters), the other three rows are measurements of time that we took in the laboratory.

The script will generate three different graphs that I used in my lab report.
